# vr_maze_unity

This is my very first VR project in Unity.
Really impressed about how quickly one can build an ellaborate environment using assets available for free on the Unity asset store.
Tools like ProGrid and ProBuilder make working with shapes a lot easier.

To get to this point I had to overcome a lot of obstacles, mainly due to outdated documentation and videos about Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit.
This project works on the latest LTS version of Unity 2021.2.16f1 and the latest versions of the XR Interaction Toolkit.
Overall, I am pleased with the outcome and the results, I have a long way to go in my Unity learning journey but I am progressing quickly.
